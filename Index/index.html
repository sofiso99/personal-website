            Hi! I'm a tech enthusiast based in New York with a growing passion
            for web development. My journey into the world of technology began
            during my final year of university, when I discovered the power of
            code and how it can bring ideas to life. Since then, I've been
            focused on learning the foundations of web development. I currently
            work with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, building responsive and
            user-friendly websites while continuously improving my skills and
            exploring new technologies. I'm excited about where this path will
            lead and always eager to take on new challenges and projects.
